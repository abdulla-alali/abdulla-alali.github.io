	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Blockchain is a distributed secure ledger that eliminates the need for centralized authority to store data. The centralized approach has several limitations as it is a Single-Point-of-Failure and a third-party might be needed. Blockchain, on the other hand, provides decentralized, secure and trustless framework that eliminates the need for a third party and enhances fault tolerance. In this paper, we investigate the potentials of customizing the behavior of Blockchain network based on the applications' requirements. In particular, we conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) - a permissioned blockchain framework. Seven different scenarios were tested to depict the Blockchain behavior in terms of end-to-end transaction latency and network throughput. Moreover, in these scenarios, the impact of different parameters, such as the batch-timeout, batch size, and number of endorsing peers, has been studied.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The current urban planning trend is to build smart cities that are advanced, safe and sustainable. To build these cities several technologies could be exploited including the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing. This motivated us to develop an IoT-based fire alarm system that uses edge computing. The developed system would be suitable in smart cities, as it mitigates issues faced by the existing fire alarm systems like installation overhead and lack of remote warning. Our system is an ad-hoc network of several sensing nodes and a single central node. Each of these sensing nodes consists of an ESP8266-nodeMCU connected to different types of sensors, such as smoke, temperature, humidity, flame, Methane and Carbon Monoxide (CO) sensors. They are responsible for sensing the environment and detecting fire which means that they are smart end nodes and hence satisfying one of the characteristics of edge computing. The nodes transfer their readings to centralized node that was implemented with a Raspberry Pi computer. Communication between the sensing node and the central node is through Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol which is carried via a bridge node. When a node detects fire, it signals the centralized node to alert the user and the fire department using the attached 4G module. An SMS is sent to them and the user is called. Users can inquire about the status of their home by sending an SMS. A prototype for the system performed the desired functionalities successfully with an average delay of less than 30 seconds and a node coverage of 1400m^2.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Project and/or problem-based learning has been implemented in higher education worldwide for a few decades. Nevertheless, in the Middle Eastern context, although problem based learning has been practiced in a few medical schools, project-based learning (PBL) remains a new phenomenon and little has been practiced in most disciplines of higher education such as engineering education, and in K12. Over the past years, several research projects were conducted examining the initial PBL implementation experiences in Qatar. In order to provide an overall picture of PBL implementation in Qatar, the study current examined how PBL has been practices, what benefits have been perceived and documented, what challenges have been encountered and what the prospects are. The following research questions guided this study: What are the characteristics of PBL implementation in Qatar? What are the benefits and challenges of implementing PBL in Qatar? What socio-cultural factors have contributed and constrained the PBL implementation?<p>Methodologically, a synthesis of the literature was employed as the research framework. A number of ten articles were selected that were appropriate for the synthesis. The findings emerged from the synthesis of the ten papers included three overarching themes – preparation for a change, process of the change implementation, evaluation of the change. Within each theme, both teachers/instructors and students’ perspectives were summarized. From the perspective of students, subthemes were identified including approaches to learning, views on and characteristics of collaboration, student engagement, and agency. From the perspective of teachers/instructors, readiness for change, fidelity of PBL implementation, agency development and professional identity negotiation. In addition, socio-cultural factors that contributing and constraining the implementation were also identified and discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations on prospects of change to PBL.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Rapid evolution of wireless medical devices and network technologies has fostered the growth of remote monitoring systems. Such new technologies enable monitoring patients' medical records anytime and anywhere without limiting patients' activities. However, critical challenges have emerged with remote monitoring systems due to the enormous amount of generated data that need to be efficiently processed and wirelessly transmitted to the service providers in time. Thus, in this paper, we leverage full-duplex capabilities for fast transmission, while tackling the trade-off between Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and consequent self-interference (SI) for efficient remote monitoring healthcare systems. The proposed framework jointly considers the residual SI resulting from simultaneous transmission and reception along with the compressibility feature of medical data in order to optimize the data transmission over wireless channels, while maintaining the application's QoS constraint. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution in terms of minimizing the transmission power, residual self-interference, and encoding distortion.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Rapid evaluation of cyber physical systems has fostered the development of viable healthcare applications for real-time remote healthcare monitoring. Leveraging wireless and implantable medical devices has enabled the treatment of various diseases through monitoring patients' medical records anytime and everywhere without limiting patients' activities. However, critical challenges have emerged with such systems due to the effect of cyber threats on the physical environment and the enormous amount of generated data that need to be processed, recorded, and wirelessly transmitted to the service providers. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the the tradeoff between security and Quality of Service (QoS) for efficient remote monitoring healthcare systems. The proposed framework has jointly consider the Secrecy Outage Probability (SOP) with adaptive compression scheme in order to optimize the medical data transmission over wireless channels, while maintaining the application layer's QoS constraint. Our simulation results show the excellent performance of the proposed solution in terms of minimizing both the SOP and encoding distortion, with respect to state-of-the-art schemes that focus only on one objective.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the past few years, a rapid increase in the number of patients requiring constant monitoring, which inspires researchers to develop intelligent and sustainable remote smart healthcare services. However, the transmission of big real-time health data is a challenge as the current dynamic networks are limited by different aspects such as the bandwidth, end-to-end delay, and transmission energy; will be an obstacle against having an efficient transmission of the data. Due to this, a data reduction technique should be applied to the data before being transmitted based on the resources of the network. In this paper, we integrate efficient data reduction with wireless networking to deliver an adaptive compression with an acceptable distortion, while reacting to the wireless network dynamics such as channel fading and user mobility. Convolutional Auto-encoder (CAE) approach was used to implement an adaptive compression/reconstruction technique with the minimum distortion. Then, a resource allocation framework was implemented to minimize the transmission energy along with the distortion of the reconstructed signal while considering different network and applications constraints such as the available bandwidth, distortion threshold, data rate threshold and the end to end delay. A comparison between the results of the resource allocation framework considering both CAE and Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) was also captured.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly accessible to the public due to their high availability with affordable prices while being equipped with better technology. However, this raises a great concern from both the cyber and physical security perspectives since UAVs can be utilized for malicious activities in order to exploit vulnerabilities by spying on private properties, critical areas or to carry dangerous objects such as explosives which makes them a great threat to the society. Drone identification is considered the first step in a multi-procedural process in securing physical infrastructure against this threat. In this paper, we present drone detection and identification methods using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). These algorithms will be utilized to exploit the unique acoustic fingerprints of the flying drones in order to detect and identify them. We propose a comparison between the performance of different neural networks based on our dataset which features audio recorded samples of drone activities. The major contribution of our work is to validate the usage of these methodologies of drone detection and identification in real life scenarios and to provide a robust comparison of the performance between different deep neural network algorithms for this application. In addition, we are releasing the dataset of drone audio clips for the research community for further analysis.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we investigate a multi-objective optimization framework for secure wireless health monitoring applications. In particular, we consider a legitimate link for the transmission of a vital EEG signal, threatened by a passive eavesdropping attack, that aims at wiretapping these measurements. We incorporate in our framework the practical secrecy metric, namely secrecy outage probability (SOP), which requires only the knowledge of side information regarding the eavesdropper (Ev), instead of completely having its instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To that end, we formulate an optimization problem in the form of maximizing the energy efficiency of the transmitter, while minimizing the distortion encountered at the signal resulting from the compression process prior to transmission, under realistic quality of service (QoS) constraints. The problem is shown to be nonconvex and NPNP-complete. Towards solving the problem, a branch and bound (BnB)-based algorithm is presented where a δδ-suboptimal solution, from the global optimal one, is obtained. Numerical results are conducted to verify the system performance, where it is shown that our proposed approach outperforms similar systems deploying fixed compression policies (FCPs). We successfully meet QoS requirements while optimizing the system objectives, at all channel conditions, which cannot be attained by these FCP approaches. Interestingly, we also show that a target secrecy rate can be practically achieved with nonzero probability, even when the Ev has a better channel condition, on the average, than that for the legitimate receiver.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Fire alarm systems are essential in alerting people to take action before fire engulf their homes. However, fire alarm systems, today, require a lot of wiring and labor to be installed. This discourages users from installing them in their homes. Therefore, we are proposing an IoT based wireless fire alarm system that is easy to install. The proposed system is an ad-hoc network that consists of several nodes distributed over the house. Each of these nodes consists of a microcontroller (ESP8266 nodeMCU) connected to smoke, temperature, humidity, flame, Methane and Carbon Monoxide (CO) sensors that continuously sense the surrounding environment to detect the presence of fire. The nodes create their own Wi-Fi network and they don’t depend on the home’s Wi-Fi router. These nodes communicate with a centralized node implemented with a Raspberry Pi microcontroller integrated with a 4G module. Once fire is detected by a node, it will send a signal to a centralized node that will be triggered to send an SMS to the fire department and the user, call the user and alert the house by producing a local alarm. The user can also get information about the status of his home via sending an SMS to the system. The sensing nodes create a mesh network and they are linked to the central node via a bridge node. Communication between the bridge node and the sensing node is through Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. A prototype was developed for the proposed system and it carried out the desired functionalities successfully with an average delay of less than 30 seconds.</td>

By creating a backdoor to the IMDs, legal authentication may be performed with the IMD and gain access to it. This work presents a procedure for an emergency team to validate their actions to the IMD without the need of the patient’s conscious. This is ensured using hashing function and elliptic curves for the security key generation. The seed that will be used will be the heart rhythm of the patient. The authentication process introduced will only allow access to the identified parties. An eavesdropper will be unable to interfere during emergency cases and threaten more the patient’s life.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Nowadays, Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) rely mainly on wireless technology for information exchange. In spite of the many advantages wireless technology offers to patients in terms of efficiency, speed and ease; it puts the patients' health in serious danger if no proper security mechanism is deployed. The IMDs rely generally on resources that are relatively simple and sometimes require surgery to be altered. Therefore, common security mechanisms cannot be simply implemented in fear of consuming all the resources held for healthcare purposes. A certain balance between security and efficiency must be found in each IMD architecture. In this work, we try to avoid encryption algorithms to protect IMDs from Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. Encryption is generally used to protect communication confidentiality. However, this method is still a subject for replay and MITM attacks. In this work, we propose to create a signature protocol that protects IMDs from MITM attempts using less resources than common encryption/decryption algorithms. This signature algorithm is dynamic, which means that the signature output depends on a key and the same message can have different signatures if this key is different. This dynamic part will be introduced using chaotic generators.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Wireless medical devices play an important role in providing safety and privacy to patients suffering from major health issues. These light-weight devices can be worn inside or outside the patient's body and provide more convenience and reliable doctor-patient communication. However, the design, development, and usage of these devices play a critical role in present network paradigm. They are vulnerable to network threats and attacks which break the confidentiality, integrity and availability protocols in networking scenarios. Thus, it is important to have identification and authentication of only the authorized peoplewho can operate the device. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm for providing trusted authentication and identification of only authorized people using ECG signal. Here, DTW algorithm is used to measure the correlation between different ECG signal records. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm with a large database consisting of users of al1 ages, including abnormal ECG data and long span of time intervals between ECG recordings for evaluating the reliability of the proposed algorithm. Comparative evaluation of the proposed sy stem show ed that, it is not only efficient, but also light weight in comparison to the existing systems.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are a growing industry regarding personal health care and monitoring. In addition, they provide patients with efficient treatments. In general, these devices use wireless communication technologies that may require synchronization with the medical team. Even though wireless technology offers satisfaction to the patient's daily life, it is still prone to security threats. Many malicious attacks on these devices can directly affect the patient's health in a lethal way. Using insecure wireless channels for these devices offers adversaries easy ways to steal the patient's private data and hijack these systems. This can cause damage to patients and render their devices unusable. In the aim of protecting these devices, we explore in this paper a new way to create symmetric encryption keys to encrypt the wireless communication held by the IMDs. This key generation will rely on chaotic systems to obtain synchronized Pseudo-Random keys that will be generated separately in the system. This generation is in a way that the communication channel will avoid a wireless key exchange, protecting the patient from key theft. Moreover, we will explore the performance of this generator from a cryptographic point of view, ensuring that these keys are safe to use for communication encryption.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Implantable medical devices are being increasingly used to treat or monitor different medical conditions. For such purposes, wireless is the most desired communication scheme to be implemented in these devices. On the other hand, the wireless scheme increases security threats on these electronic devices, and any possibility of attack on the medical device may have lethal consequences. The patients usually have their implantable medical devices configured and monitored by their doctors. But for practical purposes, most of the time they possess a remote control for daily non-critical operations. This remote control can be considered as an open gate for attackers to target those medical devices and cause major harm. Motivated by this, we analyze in this paper the communication scheme implemented in the wireless devices, having as a starting point an Implantable Insulin Pump to develop a new protocol that can be used in the remote control-implantable device communication, and that will rely on plain text messages to avoid encryption implementation. Finally, we will analyze how the novelties introduced with this protocol can secure such a wireless link.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Diabetic therapy or insulin treatment enables patients to control the blood glucose level. Today, instead of physically utilizing syringes for infusing insulin, a patient can utilize a gadget, for example, a Wireless Insulin Pump (WIP) to pass insulin into the body. A typical WIP framework comprises of an insulin pump, continuous glucose management system, blood glucose monitor, and other associated devices with all connected wireless links. This takes into consideration more granular insulin conveyance while achieving blood glucose control. WIP frameworks have progressively benefited patients, yet the multifaceted nature of the subsequent framework has posed in parallel certain security implications. This paper proposes a highly accurate yet efficient deep learning methodology to protect these vulnerable devices against fake glucose dosage. Moreover, the proposal estimates the reliability of the framework through the Bayesian network. We conduct comparative study to conclude that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art by over 15% in accuracy achieving more than 93% accuracy. Also, the proposed approach enhances the reliability of the overall system by 18% when only one wireless link is secured, and more than 90% when all wireless links are secured.</td>

In this work, we design an experimental test-bed for evaluating an un-slotted spectrum access scheme under real indoor environment conditions. To this end, we use the USRP software defined radio platform along with the GNURadio software that incorporates the PHY and MAC functions and modules. Our contribution is multi-fold. First, we design a MAC protocol to integrate the packet based transmission of the coexisting PU/SU network, while compensating for spectrum sensing imperfection as well as collision detection faults. Second, we evaluate the USRP-induced latency (delay) and show that it has random behavior. We work around it to obtain a fixed packet transmission time which is crucial for the channel access scheme realization and evaluation. Third, we perform helping experiments to quantify the spectrum sensing imperfection in terms of false alarm and detection probabilities. We also quantify the imperfection in collision detection. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the whole channel access scheme and compare its results to the classical sense-transmit scheme. We show that 28.5% increase in SU throughput can be achieved for the same PU packet collision rate.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Smart Grid (SG)-aware cellular networks are expected to decrease their energy consumption and consequently decrease the global carbon emissions. At the same time, cellular operators are required to meet the end-user requirements in terms of throughput. In this paper we propose a novel strategy to pave the way for the cellular operators to integrate with the SG. Our strategy is based on Dynamic Spectrum Assignment (DSA) approach. We formulate the trade-off situation of the operators as a reward function. The objective is to maximize the reward while decreasing the energy consumption. We study homogeneous, spatial-heterogeneous and spatio-temporal heterogeneous types of traffic. We study the performance of the proposed strategy in a dynamic electricity pricing context. We show that by adapting the spectrum utilization properly, the cellular operator can achieve higher rewards while using less energy compared to an operator deploying classical reuse, for low and intermediate traffic loads. We show also that the proposed DSA-based strategy is capable of adapting to the system dynamics; electricity pricing as well as end-users traffic.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Many spectrum sensing techniques have been proposed to allow a secondary user (SU) to utilize a primary user's (PU) spectrum through opportunistic access. However, few of them have considered the tradeoff between accuracy and energy consumption by taking into account the selfishness of the (SUs) in a distributed network. In this work, we consider spectrum sensing as a game where the payoff is the throughput of each SU/player. Each SU chooses between two actions, parallel individual sensing and sequential cooperative sensing techniques. Using those techniques, each SU will distributively decide the existence of the PU. Due to the repetitive nature of our game, we model it using evolutionary game (EG) theory which provides a suitable model that describes the behavioral evolution of the actions taken by the SUs. We address our problem in two cases, when the players are homogeneous and heterogeneous respectively. For the sake of stability, we find the equilibria that lead to evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) by proving that our system is evolutionary asymptotically stable, in both cases, under certain conditions on the sensing time and the false alarm probability.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Cognitive radio (CR) vehicular networks are poised to opportunistically use the licensed spectrum for high bandwidth inter-vehicular messaging, driver-assist functions, and passenger entertainment services. Recent rulings that mandate the use of spectrum databases introduce additional challenges in this highly mobile environment, where the CR enabled vehicles must update their spectrum data frequently and complete the data transfers with roadside base stations. As the rules allow local spectrum sensing only under the assurance of high accuracy, there is an associated tradeoff in obtaining assuredly correct spectrum updates from the database at a finite cost, compared to locally obtained sensing results that may have a finite error probability. This paper aims to answer the question of when to undertake local spectrum sensing and when to rely on database updates through a novel method of exploiting the correlation between 2G spectrum bands and TV whitespace. We describe experimental studies that validate our approach and quantify the cost savings made possible by intermittent database queries.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Sudden spectrum demands may occur in dense and congested cities, which stress the communication infrastructure. At these times, identifying alternate spectrum bands through cognitive radio (CR) technology will allow users to maintain connectivity and relieve data congestion in the unlicensed bands. However, deployment of the CR networks must be preceded by accurate simulation of these networks, given the high infrastructure costs involved in their installation. Moreover, CR protocols are often cross-layered, which cannot be trivially implemented in off-the-shelf hardware. This paper proposes a framework for the network simulator 3 (ns-3) that is suitable for large networks. Our approach introduces several CR capabilities, such as spectrum sensing, primary user detection, and spectrum hand-off. Our simulator demonstrates improvements in execution time and memory usage, when compared to the earlier versions implemented for the ns-2 environment. This paper is accompanied by the release of the full source code for further research and improvement.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Data delivery in a dynamically changing spectrum environment continues to remain an unsolved problem, with existing TCP based implementations falling short owing to their inability to react swiftly to spectrum changes. This paper proposes the first equation-based transport protocol, based on the TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) protocol, which uses the recent FCC mandated spectrum database information instead of relying on any intermediate node feedback. Not only does this approach maintain the strict end to end property required at this layer of the protocol stack, but also allows fine adjustment of the transmission rate through continuous adaptation. We explore interesting directions on how to limit repeated queries to the spectrum database and yet allow the source to control the rate effectively; when to re-start the transmissions; and how to interpret possible spectrum changes in the intermediate nodes correctly without mistaking it for normal network congestion, among others. Our extension to the ns-2 simulator enables thorough testing of various aspects of our protocol adapted for cognitive radio, called as TFRC-CR. We show through simulation an improvement of over 33% in the end to end throughput when compared with the classical TFRC.</td>

In this paper, we conduct an extensive simulation study of three different window-based TCP flavors- NewReno, Westwood+, and Compound, each of which has unique methods to determine the available bandwidth and scale the congestion window appropriately. These protocols also differ in their respective sensitivities to the metrics of round trip time, loss rate, residual buffer space, among others. These metrics exhibit divergent behavior in CR networks, as compared to classical wireless networks, owing to the frequent channel switching and spectrum sensing functions, and this influences the choice of the TCP protocol. Our ns-3 based simulation study reveals which specific rate control mechanism in these various TCP protocols are best suited for quickly adapting to varying spectrum and bandwidth conditions, and ensuring the maximum possible throughput for the connection.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. IoT is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. However, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to effectively secure the IoT ecosystem. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory novelty to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research<br>directions.</td>

Three factors were identified that influenced student engagement in a project teams, namely PBL types and its appropriateness to the nature of the course, students’ prior experiences with PBL, and team dynamics.<br>Conclusions: These results facilitate the establishment of an institutional framework supporting a progressive approach to embracing PBL. In this framework PBL implementation begins with diverse practices at the course level and has systemic change as its ultimate goal. This framework particularly aims to support an institutionalized approach to transition to PBL in a socio-cultural context (e.g., a non-western context) where instructors are as the primary and authoritative source of knowledge. The overall outcome of the study supports management of change from a lecture-based mode to PBL in a non-western context.</td>

Current technological advancements enable users to encapsulate these systems in handheld devices, which effectively increases the popularity of navigation systems and the number of users. In indoor environments, lack of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals and line of sight with orbiting satellites makes navigation more challenging compared to outdoor environments. Radio frequency (RF) signals, computer vision, and sensor-based solutions are more suitable for tracking the users in indoor environments.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This study examines engineering students’ initial readiness to transition to emergency online learning in response to COVID-19 in Qatar. A theoretical framework is proposed for understanding the factors influencing students’ readiness for change. Sequential explanatory mixed-method research was conducted, with 140 participants completing an online survey, of which 68 also contributed written reflections and 8 participated in semi-structured interviews. Exploratory factor analysis displayed a four-factor structure, including initial preparedness and motivation for online learning, self-efficacy beliefs about online learning, self-directed learning online, and support. The qualitative outcomes supported the four factors and provided further insight into their varied and nuanced manifestation. In accounting for the perceived impact of the factors on readiness, significant differences were identified regarding pedagogical mode, with students enrolled in PBL courses reporting higher readiness than those from non-PBL courses. The practical implications for preparing students for future emergency online learning are discussed.</td>

Healthcare systems are among these applications that have been revolutionized with IoT systems, introducing an IoT branch known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems. IoMT systems allow remote monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. Thus, it can provide timely patients' diagnostic that can save their life in case of emergencies. However, security in these critical systems is a major challenge facing their wide utilization. In this paper, we present state-of-the-art techniques to secure IoMT systems' data during collection, transmission, and storage. We comprehensively overview IoMT systems' potential attacks, including physical and network attacks. Our findings reveal that most security techniques do not consider various types of attacks. Hence, we propose a security framework that utilizes some of the presented security techniques. This framework covers the IoMT security requirements and can mitigate most of its known attacks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Modern technology has pushed us into the information age, making it easier to generate and record vast quantities of new data. Datasets can help in analyzing the situation to give a better understanding, and more importantly, decision making. Consequently, datasets, and uses to which they can be put, have become increasingly valuable commodities. This article describes the DroneRF dataset: a radio frequency (RF) based dataset of drones functioning in different modes, including off, on and connected, hovering, flying, and video recording. The dataset contains recordings of RF activities, composed of 227 recorded segments collected from 3 different drones, as well as recordings of background RF activities with no drones. The data has been collected by RF receivers that intercepts the drone's communications with the flight control module. The receivers are connected to two laptops, via PCIe cables, that runs a program responsible for fetching, processing and storing the sensed RF data in a database. An example of how this dataset can be interpreted and used can be found in the related research article “RF-based drone detection and identification using deep learning approaches: an initiative towards a large open source drone database” (Al-Sa'd et al., 2019).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The omnipresence of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, among civilians can lead to technical, security, and public safety issues that need to be addressed, regulated and prevented. Security agencies are in continuous search for technologies and intelligent systems that are capable of detecting drones. Unfortunately, breakthroughs in relevant technologies are hindered by the lack of open source databases for drone’s Radio Frequency (RF) signals, which are remotely sensed and stored to enable developing the most effective way for detecting and identifying these drones. This paper presents a stepping stone initiative towards the goal of building a database for the RF signals of various drones under different flight modes. We systematically collect, analyze, and record raw RF signals of different drones under different flight modes such as: off, on and connected, hovering, flying, and video recording. In addition, we design intelligent algorithms to detect and identify intruding drones using the developed RF database. Three deep neural networks (DNN) are used to detect the presence of a drone, the presence of a drone and its type, and lastly, the presence of a drone, its type, and flight mode. Performance of each DNN is validated through a 10-fold cross-validation process and evaluated using various metrics. Classification results show a general decline in performance when increasing the number of classes. Averaged accuracy has decreased from 99.7% for the first DNN (2-classes), to 84.5% for the second DNN (4-classes), and lastly, to 46.8% for the third DNN (10-classes). Nevertheless, results of the designed methods confirm the feasibility of the developed drone RF database to be used for detection and identification. The developed drone RF database along with our implementations are made publicly available for students and researchers alike.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Biometric recognition and analysis are among the most trusted features to be used by Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs). We aim to secure these devices by using these features in emergency scenarios. As patients can witness unpredictable lethal accidents, any implantable medical device should allow access to urgent medical interventions from legitimate parties. Any delay in providing immediate medical support can endanger the patient’s life. Hence, we propose in this work an authentication scheme that allows access to the implanted devices in emergency situations for only legitimate users. We have designed in the first place a scheme for authentication using Electrocardiogram instantaneous readings. Then, we joined the latter to a fixed biometric reading, which is fingerprint reading, to enable access to emergency medical teams. We have designed a scheme in a way to prevent attackers from accessing/hijacking the device even during emergency situations. This scheme has been assisted with elliptic curve cryptography to protect the wireless exchange of requested keys. The scheme relies on the instantaneous reading of the patient’s heartbeat and his/her fingerprint reading to create a secure key. This key will validate the authentication request of the new medical team. We have analyzed this scheme deeply to verify that they offer the necessary security for the patient’s life. We have tested if the wireless exchange of the key will expose the device’s privacy. We have also tested the accuracy of the authentication process to ensure a safe and a valid performance of the authentication process. The scheme has been designed with consideration to any hardware/software limitation that characterize any implantable medical device.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Deep brain stimulators (DBSs), a widely used and comprehensively acknowledged restorative methodology, are a type of implantable medical device which uses electrical stimulation to treat neurological disorders. These devices are widely used to treat diseases such as Parkinson, movement disorder, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Security in such devices plays a vital role since it can directly affect the mental, emotional, and physical state of human bodies. In worst-case situations, it can even lead to the patient's death. An adversary in such devices, for instance, can inhibit the normal functionality of the brain by introducing fake stimulation inside the human brain. Nonetheless, the adversary can impair the motor functions, alter impulse control, induce pain, or even modify the emotional pattern of the patient by giving fake stimulations through DBSs. This paper presents a deep learning methodology to predict different attack stimulations in DBSs. The proposed work uses long short-term memory, a type of recurrent network for forecasting and predicting rest tremor velocity. (A type of characteristic observed to evaluate the intensity of the neurological diseases) The prediction helps in diagnosing fake versus genuine stimulations. The effect of deep brain stimulation was tested on Parkinson tremor patients. The proposed methodology was able to detect different types of emulated attack patterns efficiently and thereby notifying the patient about the possible attack.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently rapidly grown to facilitate a wide range of innovative applications that can fundamentally change the way cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are designed. CPSs are a modern generation of systems with synergic cooperation between computational and physical potentials that can interact with humans through several new mechanisms. The main advantages of using UAVs in CPS application is their exceptional features, including their mobility, dynamism, effortless deployment, adaptive altitude, agility, adjustability, and effective appraisal of real-world functions anytime and anywhere. Furthermore, from the technology perspective, UAVs are predicted to be a vital element of the development of advanced CPSs. Therefore, in this survey, we aim to pinpoint the most fundamental and important design challenges of multi-UAV systems for CPS applications. We highlight key and versatile aspects that span the coverage and tracking of targets and infrastructure objects, energy-efficient navigation, and image analysis using machine learning for fine-grained CPS applications. Key prototypes and testbeds are also investigated to show how these practical technologies can facilitate CPS applications. We present and propose state-of-the-art algorithms to address design challenges with both quantitative and qualitative methods and map these challenges with important CPS applications to draw insightful conclusions on the challenges of each application. Finally, we summarize potential new directions and ideas that could shape future research in these areas.</td>

Thus, they play a critical role in healing and even saving lives. Current IMDs research trends concentrate on their medical reliability. However, deploying wireless technology in such applications without considering security measures may offer adversaries an easy way to compromise them. With the aim to secure these devices, we explore a new scheme that creates symmetric encryption keys to encrypt the wireless communication portion. We will rely on chaotic systems to obtain a synchronized Pseudo-Random key. The latter will be generated separately in the system in such a way that avoids a wireless key exchange, thus protecting patients from the key theft. Once the key is defined, a simple encryption system that we propose in this paper will be used. We analyze the performance of this system from a cryptographic point of view to ensure that it offers a better safety and protection for patients.</td>

Clinicians are carrying out diagnostic and screening procedures based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals collected remotely for outpatients who need continuous monitoring. High-speed transmission and analysis of large recorded ECG signals are essential, especially with the increased use of battery-powered devices. Exploring low-power alternative compression methodologies that have high efficiency and that enable ECG signal collection, transmission, and analysis in a smart home or remote location is required. Compression algorithms based on adaptive linear predictors and decimation by a factor B/K are evaluated based on compression ratio (CR), percentage root-mean-square difference (PRD), and heartbeat detection accuracy of the reconstructed ECG signal. With two databases (153 subjects), the new algorithm demonstrates the highest compression performance ( CR=6 and PRD=1.88 ) and overall detection accuracy (99.90% sensitivity, 99.56% positive predictivity) over both databases. The proposed algorithm presents an advantage for the real-time transmission of ECG signals using a faster and more efficient method, which meets the growing demand for more efficient remote health monitoring.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The surge in demand for Internet of Things (IoT) systems and applications has motivated a paradigm shift in the development of viable radio frequency identification technology (RFID)-based solutions for ubiquitous real-time monitoring and tracking. Bit tracking-based anti-collision algorithms have attracted considerable attention, recently, due to its positive impact on decreasing the identification time. We aim to extend bit tracking to work effectively over erroneous channels and scalable multi RFID readers systems. Towards this objective, we extend the bit tracking technique along two dimensions. First, we introduce and evaluate a type of bit errors that appears only in bit tracking-based anti-collision algorithms called false collided bit error in single reader RFID systems. A false collided bit error occurs when a reader perceives a bit sent by tag as an erroneous bit due to channel imperfection and not because of a physical collision. This phenomenon results in a significant increase in the identification delay. We introduce a novel, zero overhead algorithm called false collided bit error selective recovery tackling the error. There is a repetition gain in bit tracking-based anti-collision algorithms due to their nature, which can be utilized to detect and correct false collided bit errors without adding extra coding bits. Second, we extend bit tracking to “error-free”scalable mutli-reader systems, while leaving the study of multi-readers tag identification over imperfect channels for future work. We propose the multi-reader RFID tag identification using bit tracking (MRTI-BT) algorithm which allows concurrent tag identification, by neighboring RFID readers, as opposed to time-consuming scheduling. MRTI-BT identifies tags exclusive to different RFIDs, concurrently. The concept of bit tracking and the proposed parallel identification property are leveraged to reduce the identification time compared to the state-of-the-art.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Diabetic patients use therapy from the insulin pump, a type of implantable medical device, for the infusion of insulin to control blood glucose level. While these devices offer many clinical benefits, there has been a recent increase in the number of cases, wherein, the wireless communication channel of such devices has been compromised. This not only causes the device to malfunction but also potentially threatens the patient’s life. In this paper, a neural networks-based multi-layer perceptron model was designed for real-time medical device security. Machine learning algorithms are among the most effective and broadly utilized systems for classification, identification, and segmentation. Although they are effective, they are both computationally and memory intensive, making them hard to be deployed on low-power embedded frameworks. In this paper, we present an on-chip neural system network for securing diabetic treatment. The model achieved 98.1% accuracy in classifying fake versus genuine glucose measurements. The proposed model was comparatively evaluated with a linear support vector machine which achieved only 90.17% accuracy with negligible precision and recall. Moreover, the proposal estimates the reliability of the framework through the use of the Bayesian network. The proposed approach enhances the reliability of the overall framework by 18% when only one device is secured, and over 90% when all devices are secured.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Cognitive radio (CR) vehicular networks are poised to opportunistically use the licensed spectrum for high-bandwidth intervehicular messaging, driver-assist functions, and passenger entertainment services. Recent rulings that mandate the use of spectrum databases have introduced additional challenges in this highly mobile environment, where the CR-enabled vehicles must update their spectrum data frequently and complete the data transfers with roadside base stations (BSs) in very short interaction times. This paper aims to answer two fundamental questions: 1) when to undertake local spectrum sensing, as opposed to accessing spectrum database information at a finite cost overhead; and 2) how to ensure correct packet receptions among the multiple BSs and CR vehicles using fewer slots than the messages that need to be transmitted. The contributions of this paper are twofold: First, we introduce a method of qualifying the correctness of spectrum sensing results using out-of-band 2G spectrum data using experimental results. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on applying the concept of interference alignment (IA) in a practical network setting, leading to dramatic reduction in message transmission times. Our approach demonstrates significant reductions in the overhead of direct database queries and improvement in the accuracy of spectrum sensing for mobile vehicles.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Reliable and high throughput data delivery in cognitive radio networks remains an open challenge owing to the inability of the source to quickly identify and react to changes in spectrum availability. The window-based rate adaptation in TCP relies on acknowledgments (ACKs) to self trigger the sending rate, which are often delayed or lost owing to intermittent primary user (PU) activity, resulting in an incorrect inference of congestion by the source node. This paper proposes the first equation-based transport protocol based on TCP Friendly Rate Control for Cognitive Radio, called as TFRC-CR, which allows immediate changes in the transmission rate based on the spectrum-related changes in the network environment. TFRC-CR has the following unique features: (i) it leverages the recent FCC mandated spectrum databases with minimum querying overhead, (ii) it enables fine adjustment of the transmission rate by identifying the instances of true network congestion, as well as (iii) provides guidelines on when to re-start the source transmission after a pause due to PU activity. TFRC-CR is evaluated through an extensive set of module additions to the ns-2 simulator which is also released for further investigation by the research community.</td>
